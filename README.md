# SniffNetBar

Fork of Sniffnet, extended into a macOS menu bar application with passive threat visibility.

## What it does

- Monitors network traffic in the macOS menubar
- Captures and analyzes packets with libpcap
- Tracks totals, packet counts, top hosts, and top connections
- **Shows which process is creating each network connection**
- Resolves hostnames with reverse DNS
- Supports TCP, UDP, ICMP, IPv4, and IPv6
- Includes an embedded map view (Leaflet) for public IP geolocation

## Requirements

- macOS 10.13 or later
- libpcap (install via Homebrew: `brew install libpcap`)
- Xcode Command Line Tools
- A valid Apple code signing certificate (see "Helper signing" below)

## Helper signing (required for install)

SniffNetBar uses a privileged helper installed via `SMAppService`. The helper only accepts
connections from a signed app with the same Team ID, so you must sign both the app and
helper with a real Apple certificate (ad-hoc signing will fail).

1. Create or install a signing certificate in Keychain (for local dev, "Apple Development"
   works; for distribution, use "Developer ID Application").
2. Set the `CODESIGN_IDENTITY` used by the Makefile:
   - One-off: `CODESIGN_IDENTITY="Apple Development: Your Name (TEAMID)" make`
   - Or create `SniffNetBar/Makefile.local` and set `CODESIGN_IDENTITY = Apple Development: Your Name (TEAMID)`

If `CODESIGN_IDENTITY` is not set, the build will succeed but the helper install/connection
will fail at runtime.

## Build

```bash
make
```

This creates `build/SniffNetBar.app`.

## Compilation

1. **Prepare the environment** – install Xcode command line tools (`xcode-select --install`) and `libpcap` (`brew install libpcap`). The Makefile (`SniffNetBar/Makefile`) assumes Homebrew puts headers in `/opt/homebrew` or `/usr/local`, so adjust `PCAP_INCLUDE` and `PCAP_LIBDIR` if that differs.
2. **Configure signing** – the privileged helper must be signed with the same identity as the main app. Export your certificate into `CODESIGN_IDENTITY` before running `make`, for example `CODESIGN_IDENTITY="Apple Development: Your Name (TEAMID)" make`. To keep builds repeatable, copy your identity name into `SniffNetBar/Makefile.local` and set `CODESIGN_IDENTITY = Apple Development: Your Name (TEAMID)` there.
3. **Build from scratch** – clean stale artifacts (`make clean`) and build with `make` or `CODESIGN_IDENTITY="…" make`. The default target compiles the app, helper, scripts, and CLI utilities while signing both bundles and updating the helper plist if a code signature is present.
4. **Optional tooling** – the target also builds helpers such as `register_helper`, `status_helper`, `set_apikey`, etc., which are copied into the bundle for installation/registration later.

## Certificate constraints

The helper explicitly validates the connecting app’s bundle and team identifiers (`SniffNetBarHelper/SNBPrivilegedHelperService.m:120-235`). It caches its own `teamIdentifier` (via `SNBTeamIdentifierForSelf`) and returns `NO` from `validateConnection:` whenever `kSecCodeInfoTeamIdentifier` is missing or does not match (`SniffNetBarHelper/SNBPrivilegedHelperService.m:224-235`). Self-signed identities lack an Apple-issued team ID, so the helper refuses their connections; only Apple Development/Developer ID certificates that embed the same team ID for both app and helper can run SniffNetBar end-to-end.

## Install

```bash
make install
```

This copies `SniffNetBar.app` to `~/Applications/`.

## Run

Packet capture requires root privileges on macOS.

```bash
sudo ~/Applications/SniffNetBar.app/Contents/MacOS/SniffNetBar
```

Or if building locally:

```bash
sudo ./build/SniffNetBar.app/Contents/MacOS/SniffNetBar
```

## Usage

1. Launch the application (requires sudo for packet capture)
2. Click the menubar icon to view traffic statistics
3. Select "Network Interface" to choose which interface to monitor
4. Toggle top hosts/connections and the map view as needed

## Passive threat visibility

- Highlights public IPs from active connections in the map view
- Helps spot unexpected destinations and unusual traffic patterns
- Designed for quick, passive situational awareness from the menubar

## Limitations

- Requires `sudo` to capture packets on macOS
- Simplified IPv6 parsing (extension headers not fully parsed)
- No port-to-service name mapping
- Menubar UI only (no full desktop UI)

## Map provider

The map uses Leaflet + OpenStreetMap tiles and looks up IP locations via a provider:

- `ipinfo.io` (default)
- `ip-api.com` (fallback to `ipinfo.io` on 403)
- Custom provider via UserDefaults:
  - `MapProvider` = `custom`
  - `MapProviderURLTemplate` = e.g. `https://example.com/geo/%@`
  - `MapProviderLatKey` = key path to latitude (default `lat`)
  - `MapProviderLonKey` = key path to longitude (default `lon`)
